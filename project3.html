                <h2>About This Project</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a pixel-style roguelike game and one of my long-term solo projects. I've been developing it for over 5 years, handling everything from art, programming, and music to game design and storytelling—all by myself. It's planned for release in 2026 and will be available across all major platforms. Stay tuned!
                </p>

                <p>
                This is a very special project—one born from the dream of a 7-year-old boy named Logan from the United States. Logan loves playing video games and dreamed of turning a little pigeon he designed into a real game. His father, John, reached out to me to help make that dream come true.
                </p>

                <p>
                Using Logan’s original hand-drawn sketches, I created the first prototype, which thrilled him beyond words. As development progressed, I brought in a talented artist and a level designer to form a small team with John, and together we’ve been building this game ever since.
                </p>

                <p>
                In 2024, we launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/logan-dad/pigeons-mission-a-pixel-packed-
platforming-action-game?ref=discovery&term=Pigeon%27s%20Mission&total_hits=1&category_id=35" style="color: #00bfff; text-decoration: underline;">Kickstarter campaign</a> and raised over $20,000 in support. In May 2025, our game proudly won the <a href="https://youtu.be/xvuyyXhXApE?t=9341" style="color: #00bfff; text-decoration: underline;">Chat’s Choice Award</a> at the OTK Games Expo, along with a $5,000 prize.
                </p>

                <p>
                The game is still in development and is planned for a full release across all major platforms by the end of 2025. Stay tuned—Logan’s dream is becoming a reality.
